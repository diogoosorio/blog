## Welcome to Diogo's personal blog

My poor attempt of writing a small static blog generator (Ã  la [Jekyll][1]). This time the main weapons of choice were [Python][2] and [Flask][3].

During this first (quick) iteration, the blog entries are being loaded and parsed from the hard-drive when a request comes in. In the near future, the objective is to have this proccess automatized, whenever a blog entry is edited/added (add a watch operation).

I had three main objectives in mind, developing this: 

* To remove the MongoDB dependency that the previous blog version had 
* To add a simpler, content centered, responsive design
* To be able to write the entries using Markdown

The three of them were achieved. There are a lot of nice-to-have's that I'd like to add, but one just has so many off-days per week. :)
